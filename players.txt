xmms

great plugin architecture
have to export plugin code as ANSI C :/
works great w/null output plugin, but real output plugins are way too coarse

rhythmbox
--
gnome/gstreamer-based
annoying to use
plugins are in c#/mono! (ipc is with dbus)

mpd
--
music player platform - player is headless, ui clients drive it over network!
only supports song position at *second* granularity. would need to patch mpd
core to change this. boo.

zinf
--
evidently has plugins, but *no* docs on writing them
use ui/cmdline/* as example
done, but it segfaults on startup; even built with debugging symbols, the crash
is in unknown code. :/
