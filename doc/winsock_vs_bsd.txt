    WSAStartup()

Winsock:
must call WSAStartup() first and WSACleanup last. eg:

	WSADATA wsaData;   // if this doesn't work
    //WSAData wsaData; // then try this instead

    if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1, 1), &wsaData) != 0) {
        cerr << "WSAStartup failed." << endl;
		goto failed_init;
    }

BSD:
don't have to do anything first.




    #include

Winsock:
#include <winsock.h> (or maybe <winsock2.h>)

BSD:
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netdb.h>




    closing sockets

Winsock:
closesocket(socket)

BSD:
close(socket)




    read/write

Winsock:
must use recv and send.

BSD:
sockets are file descriptors, so you can use read/write.




    INADDR_NONE

Winsock:
it's defined.

BSD:
some platforms (e.g. Solaris) don't define it. #define it to -1.




    sizeof

This isn't really a socket-specific thing, but...

Windows:
sizeof returns int.

BSD:
sizeof returns uint.
