- existing solutions, BASS and whatever the other one was, are both unusable 

- one hard problem: synchronization. one good idea: cheat! (with ntp)

- vast majority of projects at sf, freshmeat, codecon, are big, ambitious
infrastructure projects. it's not clear that this is a good thing.

1) infrastructure's users are developers. stand-alone apps' users are normal
people. there are a lot fewer of us than of normal people!

2) infrastructure requires months of third-party developer effort, on average,
to use. apps require d/ling and using - say, half an hour.

3) it's rare that any existing problem is entirely solved by a new piece of
infrastructure. they don't solve single problems as much as they *partially*
solve a class of problems. who wants partial solutions?

there's lots of infrastructure out there. i know it's more fun to build, but at
the end of the day,  consider using *existing* infrastructure, or
extending it if absolutely necessary, and writing stand-alone apps!
